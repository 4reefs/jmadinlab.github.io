Our paper looking at relationships between 2D planar area and surface area and volume has been published at [PeerJ](https://peerj.com/articles/4280). The paper was a collaboration between reef ecologists and medical imaging specialists, and demonstrates tight relationships between what ecologists traditionally measure on the reef, planar size, and traits related to lifestyle (e.g., physiology and demography), surface are and volume.
