A collaboration between marine scientists at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa and local artists resulted in a beautiful and inspiring laboratory space at the Hawaiʻi Institute of Marine Biology (HIMB).

Elizabeth Madin and Josh Madin joined the UH Mānoa School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology as HIMB research professors in May 2018. In their shared lab space, they conduct quite different yet complementary research. Their main areas of overlap are coral reefs and ocean conservation.

When the researchers first saw the un-renovated version of what is now their lab space, Elizabeth Madin imagined a lively, underwater mural. She shared her passion for creating art with Beth Lentz, an HIMB graduate student who conceived of and directed the SymbioSEAS science-art collaboration, and eventually connected with local artists Nicole Makaʻāhinaʻālohilohi Jack, Kūpono Duncan and Cory Kamehanaokalā Taum.
