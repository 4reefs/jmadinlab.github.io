### Research

My research interests revolves around understanding the hierarchical mechanisms of reef geometric complexity underlying coral reef biodiversity.  Specifically, I’m interested in quantifying and predicting the structural consequences of climate-associated disturbances and how these cascade along ecological lines to affect coral reefs ecological functions locally and regionally.
